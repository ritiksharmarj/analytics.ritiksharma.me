Get started

Step 1 - Add website
To have your website listed, login and add the website’s domain.

Step 2 - Add code snippet
To add Splitbee to your website, add the following script tag to the <head> of your website.

<script src="https://analytics.ritiksharma.me/script.js" />

Make sure to include the async or defer attribute. It allows your page to load without waiting for the script.

It will only show data coming from your project domain directly. It will not accept data from development environments.

Step 3 - Check the script
Once you add the script to your site, reload the deployed site’s page with the script to ensure it sends the first page view.

Go to the dashboard/:siteId to verify that the page view has been sent and is displayed on the charts.
